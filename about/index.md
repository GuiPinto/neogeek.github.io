Hi! I'm Scott Doxey, a Boston based web developer who loves to tinker. I'm currently working as a User Experience Consultant at [Cantina](http://cantina.co). When I'm not crafting awesome user experiences at Cantina you can find me hacking away on any number of open source projects. Most recently I have been developing [Facade.js](http://facadejs.com), an HTML5 canvas library and [doxdox](http://doxdox.org), an HTML and Markdown documentation generator. Previously Iâ€™ve released [Reader.py](https://github.com/neogeek/reader.py) an inbox-zero take on RSS readers and the [Overseer Framework](https://github.com/neogeek/Overseer-Framework) a PHP micro-framework.
