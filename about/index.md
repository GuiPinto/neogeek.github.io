Hi! I'm Scott Doxey, a Boston based web developer who loves to tinker. I'm currently working as a User Experience Consultant at [Cantina](http://cantina.co). When I'm not crafting awesome user experiences at Cantina you can find me hacking away at any one of my open source projects. Most recently I have been developing an HTML5 canvas library called [Facade.js](http://facadejs.com)). Previously I released [Reader.py](https://github.com/neogeek/reader.py) an inbox-zero take on RSS readers, [doxdox](https://github.com/neogeek/doxdox) a dox documentation generator and the [Overseer Framework](https://github.com/neogeek/Overseer-Framework) a PHP micro-framework.
