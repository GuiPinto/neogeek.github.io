title: Write Your Own Library, and Then Don't Use It
description: A little over a year ago I started writing a library for drawing in JavaScript Canvas. And while I've rebuilt it three times, I haven't used it in an actual project.
year: 2014

I wanted to build a game. And not just any game; I had grand plans of adventure, suspense and triumph over individuality. That was over a year ago. Instead what I ended up with was a constantly evolving library and greater knowledge of how invaluable it is to build your own library.

This library has taught me a great deal about JavaScript inheritance, HTML5 Canvas, [Grunt](http://gruntjs.com), [Bower](http://bower.io), unit testing, and writing proper documentation. These are things I would have learned eventually as most of them were on a long bucket list of things to learn, but because I encountered the need for each one of them naturally I learned far more than I would have from a tutorial or a book.

While it was not originally my plan to ignore my library while developing other projects, it has exposed me to many new technologies. I would highly recommend to anyone who wants to sharpen their skills in any area of web development to build a library related to it.

Either that or write a book.
